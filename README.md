## Nicknames: 

"3D Konami Logo", "Laser Bacon Strips"

## Logo: 

Against a black background, a spark draws a laser line at the top of the screen. It moves downward until a dark outline of the Konami logo is shown. Colors fill the Konami logo (the top ribbon orange, the bottom ribbon red, and "KONAMI" silver) and textures as the background fades to white.

## Variants:

* A purple laser variant is used on all Super Famicom/Super Nintendo games.
* On Sega Mega Drive/Genesis versions of Konami games, there was a variant with a green laser line being drawn out. This could also be spotted on the Sega CD Konami games (such as Snatcher).
* On PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 versions of Konami games, there was a variant with a blue line being drawn out.

## FX/SFX: 

The line animation (whether it's purple for Super Nintendo/Super Famicom, green for Genesis/Mega Drive, or blue for TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine) and the color fill.

## Music/Sounds: 

An ascending/descending bell-like synth sound as the color appears (which sounds different depending on the game/system); otherwise silent. 

* Sega Genesis: The music is done on an electric piano.
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System: The theme is done using synth chimes.
* NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16: The theme is done on a synth-organ.

There are unconfirmed sources claiming Tomoya Tomita and Kinuyo Yamashita composed the Konami logo jingle sound.

## Availability: 

Seen on all Konami releases for the SNES and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (and the Sega CD/Mega CD add-on), as well as some for the NEC TurboGrafx 16/PC Engine. The logo is preserved on Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP and Wii Virtual Console versions of Konami releases as well as the Anniversary Collections for both.Contra and Castlevania on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
